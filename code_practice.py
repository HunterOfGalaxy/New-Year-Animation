# sum along the axis 0 and axis 1 of a 2D array using pandas dataframe is as = df.sum(axis=0) and df.sum(axis=1)
# why lambda function is used in python? answer: lambda function is used to create small anonymous functions.
# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
# for example: x = lambda a : a + 10 print(x(5)) # output: 15

# to_timestamp() is a method used to convert a string to a timestamp for example: df['date_time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_time']), it works like string to timestamp conversion, e.g. 2020-01-29 00:00:00 to 2020-01-29 00:00:00 where it converts the string part i.e. 2020-01-29 to timestamp part i.e. 2020-01-29 00:00:00
